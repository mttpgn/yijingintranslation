Yijing in Translation is written using wxPython. It provides a number of different 
translations of the Yijing (or I Ching). This is the ancient Chinese book of divination 
which uses randomness to answer questions both personal and cosmic. The text can be 
read straight through or accessed through a number of different randomness modules.
