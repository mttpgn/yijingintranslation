Yijing in Translation is written using wxPython. It provides a number of 
different translations of the Yijing (or I Ching). This is the ancient 
Chinese book of divination which uses randomness to answer questions both 
personal and cosmic. The text can be read straight through or accessed 
through a number of different randomness modules. Adobe Acroread is used 
to view the pdf files for each page of the translation texts.
